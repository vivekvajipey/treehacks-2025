# Structured Annotation Generation System Design

## Architecture Overview
The system is designed to analyze documents in real-time and produce structured annotations (insights) that can be easily visualized in a PDF viewer. It breaks down the document into manageable blocks and processes them sequentially, ensuring that earlier context informs later analysis. The architecture balances **generic analysis** (AI-driven insights) and **guided analysis** (user-specified themes) to generate meaningful annotations.

## Document Processing Pipeline
- **Block Segmentation**: The document (e.g., PDF or text) is parsed and divided into logical blocks, such as paragraphs, sections, or text boxes. Each block is assigned a unique `block_id` and associated with its page number.
- **Sequential Processing**: Blocks are processed in order, one after the other, rather than all at once. This approach maintains coherence across the document – insights from earlier blocks can influence understanding of later blocks ([Migrating from RefineDocumentsChain | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_chains/refine_docs_chain/#:~:text=,sequence%20of%20documents%20until%20finished)). For example, the system might carry a running summary or context state as it moves through the blocks, refining its analysis with each new block ([Migrating from RefineDocumentsChain | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_chains/refine_docs_chain/#:~:text=,sequence%20of%20documents%20until%20finished)).
- **Context Maintenance**: As each block is processed, the AI agent keeps track of key points or themes encountered so far. This *incremental understanding* ensures that if Block 5 refers to a concept introduced in Block 2, the system recognizes that connection. Techniques similar to iterative refinement (processing the first chunk, then updating the result as new chunks come in) help preserve context over long documents ([Migrating from RefineDocumentsChain | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_chains/refine_docs_chain/#:~:text=,sequence%20of%20documents%20until%20finished)).
- **Parallelization (Optional)**: While the default is sequential (to preserve context), non-dependent sections could be processed in parallel for speed. In the initial design, however, we prioritize sequential logic to get correctness, and later optimizations can introduce parallel processing if needed (e.g., process each chapter separately, then merge insights).

## Types of AI "Ruminations"
The system supports two modes of insight generation, addressing different needs:

- **Generic Ruminations**: In this mode, the AI agent automatically determines interesting or important insights from each block *without any specific prompt from the user*. This is analogous to a generic summary or commentary – the agent considers all information equally, highlighting what it finds noteworthy ([untitled](https://hpcclab.org/paperPdf/surveyTextSum.pdf#:~:text=generic%20versus%20query,4)). For example, it might flag a **key finding** or **unusual phrase** in the text and provide an analysis for it.
- **Guided Ruminations**: In this mode, the AI focuses on a user-specified **theme or query**. This is similar to query-based or focused summarization – the user asks the system to pay attention to a particular topic or angle ([untitled](https://hpcclab.org/paperPdf/surveyTextSum.pdf#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20in,4)). For instance, if the user is interested in "security issues" in a policy document, the system will highlight phrases related to security and provide insights about them, ignoring other unrelated content. The AI uses the given theme to filter and prioritize which phrases to annotate (e.g., using keyword matching or semantic similarity to the theme).
- **Switching Modes**: The backend can handle both modes using the same pipeline by simply adjusting the filtering criteria. If a theme is provided (guided), the insight generator includes only theme-relevant phrases; if not, it defaults to generic insights. This design allows dynamic adjustment – a user could first read generic insights, then request guided insights on a specific topic without reprocessing the whole document from scratch (the system can reuse the analyzed data, just presenting a filtered view).

## Insight Output Structure
Each extracted insight is packaged in a structured format to facilitate frontend rendering and interaction. The output for each insight will include the following fields:

- **`phrase`**: The exact text snippet or key phrase from the document that the insight is about. This is the portion of text that will be highlighted. For example, `"high performance computing"` might be a phrase from the document.
- **`insight`**: The AI-generated analysis or commentary for that phrase. This is a sentence or two (or a short paragraph) explaining why the phrase is important or providing additional context. For example, an insight might be "This phrase highlights the need for powerful computational resources in the project, suggesting potential scalability issues."
- **`start_index`** and **`end_index`**: Integers indicating the character positions where the `phrase` begins and ends within its block of text. These indices act like a *TextPositionSelector* for anchoring the highlight in the text ([Notes for an annotation SDK – Jon Udell](https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/03/notes-for-an-annotation-sdk/#:~:text=There%20are%2C%20however%2C%20cases%20where,which%20passage%20contains%20the%20selection)). For instance, if `start_index: 15` and `end_index: 38`, the phrase occurs at that character range in the block.
- **`block_id`**: An identifier for the document block that contains this phrase. This corresponds to the segmented block (paragraph or section) in the original document. Using the `block_id`, the frontend can locate which block (and thus where on the page) the phrase comes from. e.g., `"block_3"` or an index like `3` if blocks are numbered.
- **`page_number`**: The page of the document on which this block (and phrase) appears. This helps the frontend viewer jump to the correct page and is useful for user context (so they know where in the document this insight is).
- **`related_insights`**: A list of references to other insight entries that are related by theme or context. For example, if multiple insights pertain to "security", each of those might list the others in their `related_insights`. This could be a list of insight IDs or indices (e.g., `[5, 7]` meaning insight #5 and #7 are related), or a list of objects linking to those insights. The purpose is to let the frontend highlight or navigate between them easily (for instance, hovering over a "security" insight could highlight all security-related highlights, or clicking could bring up a list of all related insights).

This JSON structure is optimized for the UI:
- It mirrors how web annotation standards anchor text by quote and position, ensuring the highlight can be accurately placed ([Notes for an annotation SDK – Jon Udell](https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/03/notes-for-an-annotation-sdk/#:~:text=There%20are%2C%20however%2C%20cases%20where,which%20passage%20contains%20the%20selection)).
- It is lightweight and serializes naturally to JSON (just primitive fields and lists).
- By including contextual info like block and page, the frontend doesn't need to do heavy text searches to find the location — it has direct references.
- The structure also supports interactivity: the `related_insights` field creates an implicit link network between highlights of the same theme, which the UI can use to, say, color-code or allow jumping between insights on click.

## Backend Architecture and API Design
The backend is built around a FastAPI server, integrating the insight generation pipeline into the existing application. Key components and their interactions are as follows:

- **Insight Generation Module**: This is the core logic (could be a set of functions or classes) that takes a document or block of text and produces the insights (the structured data described above). It likely uses an NLP model or LLM to identify key phrases and generate commentary. For guided mode, it takes an extra parameter for the theme (to filter relevant content).
- **Temporary Storage**: Since we are not using a database initially, the insights can be stored in memory or as a temporary JSON file. For example, when a document is processed, the resulting insights might be saved as `insights_{document_id}.json`. This makes it easy to serve repeated requests for the same document without re-processing each time (useful if the user reloads or if multiple users request it). CSV could be used if needed, but JSON is more natural for hierarchical data.
- **API Routes**: We expose a set of HTTP endpoints via FastAPI:
  - `POST /documents/{doc_id}/analyze` – Takes an input document (or references an already uploaded document by ID) and initiates the analysis. It could return the insights JSON directly in the response. Optionally, if analysis is long, this could trigger background processing and return a job ID, but given *real-time* requirements, we assume the document is processed quickly enough to respond synchronously for now.
  - `GET /documents/{doc_id}/insights` – Returns the JSON list of insights for the specified document. If a `mode` or `theme` parameter is provided, it can filter the insights (e.g., `GET /documents/123/insights?theme=security` returns only security-related insights, i.e., guided ruminations). Without a theme, it returns the generic ruminations by default. The response is in JSON and directly consumable by the client.
  - `GET /documents/{doc_id}/insights/{block_id}` (optional) – Could return insights for a specific block or page. This might be used if the frontend wants to load highlights one block at a time as the user scrolls (for performance, loading insights lazily). For example, `GET /documents/123/insights?page=2` could retrieve all insights on page 2.
- **FastAPI Integration**: We define Pydantic models for the insight structure to enforce the schema. FastAPI automatically serializes the Pydantic objects or Python dicts to JSON when returning the response ([python - How to return data in JSON format using FastAPI? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73972660/how-to-return-data-in-json-format-using-fastapi#:~:text=The%20first%20option%20is%20to,application%2Fjson)). This means our endpoint can simply do `return insights` (where `insights` is a list of dicts or Pydantic models) and FastAPI will handle the JSON encoding and HTTP response ([python - How to return data in JSON format using FastAPI? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73972660/how-to-return-data-in-json-format-using-fastapi#:~:text=The%20first%20option%20is%20to,application%2Fjson)). Real-time performance is achieved by keeping the analysis in-memory and lightweight; the absence of a database round-trip also keeps latency low.
- **No Persistence by Design**: By not using a database initially, we avoid overhead for this prototype. The JSON/CSV output can be regenerated or updated on the fly. If the document changes or the user requests a different theme, the system can generate a new insights set and simply overwrite the old JSON. In a future iteration, we might add caching or persistent storage once the format stabilizes.

**Example**: After uploading a document with ID `abc123`, a client could call `POST /documents/abc123/analyze` (optionally with a JSON body like `{"theme": "security"}` for guided mode). The server processes the doc and returns a JSON array of insights. Later, if the frontend needs just the data (and not to re-run analysis), it can call `GET /documents/abc123/insights` to fetch the stored results. This separation allows pre-processing (analysis) to be triggered independently of retrieval, if needed.

## Frontend Integration and UI Features
The frontend (e.g., a custom PDF viewer or a web app using PDF.js) will integrate these insights to provide an interactive reading experience. Key integration points:

- **Highlight Rendering**: When a page of the PDF is displayed, the frontend queries the backend for insights related to that page (e.g., `GET /documents/abc123/insights?page=5`). It then takes the returned insights and highlights the corresponding text in the PDF viewer. Using the `block_id` and `start_index/end_index`, the UI can locate the exact text span. For instance, if a viewer has the text content of each block, it can find the substring for that range and wrap it in a highlight element (like a `<mark>` tag or a transparent overlay div). Many PDF viewers allow programmatic highlights; for example, using PDF.js one can overlay a transparent yellow rectangle over text spans to indicate a highlight ([How to use PDF.js to highlight text programmatically | Nutrient](https://www.nutrient.io/blog/how-to-add-highlight-annotations-to-pdfs-in-javascript/#:~:text=After%20executing%20these%20steps%2C%20the,top%20of%20the%20PDF%20pages)). The `phrase` text can be used to double-check the highlight (and as the content of a tooltip or sidebar entry).
- **Insight Display**: The insight `analysis` text can be displayed to the user when they interact with the highlight. Two common UI patterns are:
  - **Sidebar or Panel**: Display a list of insights alongside the document. Each insight entry shows the highlighted phrase (maybe bolded) and the AI insight. If the user clicks an entry, the PDF viewer could scroll to that phrase and flash the highlight.
  - **Tooltip/Popover**: When the user hovers or clicks on a highlighted phrase in the document, show a small popup with the insight text. This allows readers to see context without leaving the page view.
- **Related Insight Linking**: The `related_insights` field provides a way to navigate or emphasize connected insights:
  - The UI can use this to, say, highlight all related phrases in a certain color when one is focused. For example, all *security-related* insights might get a blue highlight. If the user clicks on a "security" insight, the sidebar could filter to show only security insights, or the viewer could momentarily highlight all security-related phrases together.
  - Alternatively, if the insights are listed in a sidebar grouped by theme, the `related_insights` essentially links items in the same group. Clicking on one could auto-scroll to the next related one, etc.
  - This makes it easy for users to follow a theme through the document. It’s a bit like hyperlinking sections of text that share a topic.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Because the system works in real-time, the frontend could request insights on the fly. For instance, as the user flips to a new page, the app calls the API for that page’s insights and renders highlights immediately. With FastAPI and no heavy DB calls, such requests should be fast (typically just a file read or memory lookup plus JSON serialization). This lazy loading ensures we only compute or fetch what the user needs to see, optimizing performance.
- **Error Handling and Fallbacks**: If no insights are available for a page (e.g., in guided mode, some pages might not have any content on the theme), the frontend should handle that gracefully (no highlights shown, maybe a message "No insights on this page for theme X"). The API could return an empty list for that query, which the frontend interprets accordingly.
- **Visual Design**: The highlights should be styled not to obstruct reading. Typically, a semi-transparent color is used (like yellow with 50% opacity, similar to a real highlighter pen ([How to use PDF.js to highlight text programmatically | Nutrient](https://www.nutrient.io/blog/how-to-add-highlight-annotations-to-pdfs-in-javascript/#:~:text=After%20executing%20these%20steps%2C%20the,top%20of%20the%20PDF%20pages))). The user might also toggle insight layers on/off if they want to read the document cleanly.

## Sample JSON Output
Below is an example of what the insights JSON might look like for a document. This example shows two insights, including how related insights might be referenced:

```json
[
  {
    "phrase": "high performance computing",
    "insight": "Emphasizes the need for significant computational resources, indicating potential scalability requirements for the project.",
    "start_index": 55,
    "end_index": 79,
    "block_id": "block_3",
    "page_number": 2,
    "related_insights": [1] 
  },
  {
    "phrase": "security protocols",
    "insight": "Highlights requirements for data protection and integrity. This ties into other mentions of system security in the document.",
    "start_index": 120,
    "end_index": 138,
    "block_id": "block_5",
    "page_number": 3,
    "related_insights": [] 
  }
]
```

In this JSON array:
- The first insight (index 0) is about "high performance computing". Its `related_insights: [1]` indicates it is linked to the insight at index 1 (perhaps both relate to a theme like *technical requirements* if we imagine a theme).
- The second insight (index 1) is about "security protocols" and currently has no related insights listed (empty array). If there were other security-related phrases, they would be listed here. (In a real scenario, if both insight 0 and 1 were related by a theme like "infrastructure considerations", they would list each other’s indices.)
- Each insight knows its location (`block_id` and `page_number`) and the exact text it covers (`phrase` with indices).

This structure can be easily extended. For example, if we wanted to include a unique `insight_id` for each insight (instead of using array index), we could add an `"id"` field. The `related_insights` could then list those IDs. The example keeps it simple with array indices for illustration.

## UI-Friendly Linking of Insights
To make the experience seamless, the insights are linked and displayed in a user-friendly way:
- **Consistent Color-Coding**: If the user is in *guided* mode for a theme, all highlights could share a distinct color (e.g., all "security" insights in blue). If multiple themes are shown together (in generic mode, various themes), the system might choose different highlight colors for different clusters of related insights, or simply use one color for all and differentiate by an icon or label in the insight text.
- **Interactive Links**: In the insights panel or tooltip, related insights can be clickable. For instance, the insight about "high performance computing" might have a link or hint saying "See also: security protocols" if they're related. Clicking that could scroll the document to the "security protocols" phrase and/or open that insight’s details. This cross-reference helps users jump between parts of the document that discuss the same concept.
- **Back-end Support for Linking**: The `related_insights` field is essentially a pointer. The front-end can resolve that (by looking up those array indices or IDs in the current insights list) to, for example, generate a hyperlink. Because the insight data is already loaded in JSON, this lookup is instant on the client side (no additional server call needed to find related items).
- **Theme Filtering UI**: If guided ruminations are used, the UI could show the current theme ("Security") prominently. The user might switch theme by selecting from a dropdown, which would trigger a new API call for guided insights on the new theme, and then update the highlights accordingly. In generic mode, the UI might list themes that were detected (if the system groups related insights by topic). The user could click a theme label (say "Performance") to highlight just those, effectively switching to guided view for that theme on the fly.
- **Smooth Highlight Coordination**: The system ensures that even if multiple related phrases are on different pages, the user can navigate them. For example, if two related insights are far apart, the UI might provide "Next insight" / "Previous insight" buttons that follow the `related_insights` chain or simply the next insight in reading order. Since each insight knows its page, jumping is straightforward (e.g., scroll to page, find block, highlight text).
